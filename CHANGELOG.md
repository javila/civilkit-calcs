# Changelog

All notable changes are listed here, newest first. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versions are numbered YY.M.N with no zero padding (26.10.1 is the first release of October 2026; N counts the releases
of the month and restarts at 1), which is valid semver for Cargo and npm. Tags are `v26.10.1`.
CalcpadCE's own version is tracked separately in NOTICE.

## [26.10.1] - 2026-10-22

First public release, named CivilKit Calcs. It is a derivative of CalcpadCE (MIT): its web frontend and
worksheet language, with the engine, highlighter and Word and Excel export reimplemented in Rust.

### Added
- Rust calculation engine compiled to WebAssembly, in place of the .NET engine and server; no calculation
  request leaves the page.
- A second WebAssembly module for editor services (highlighting, linting, prettifier, definitions, the 1166-snippet
  library), loaded on first use.
- Word export (equations as Office Math) and Excel export (a Report sheet with text, equations, tables, pictures and
  native charts, plus Variables, Inputs and Plot data sheets), both built in the page.
- `#UI` input forms with select, radio and checkbox values carried into the report; dark theme for the preview.
- Samples browser with 101 worksheets from CalcpadCE's examples, their input fields rewritten as `#UI`.
- Ribbon interface with ten tabs, palette popovers with a Common section above the full snippet library, and icons in
  light and dark.
- Model bindings (`civilkit: bind` comments): specification, parser and in-app display; connecting a model is not
  implemented yet.
- Worksheet scripts limited to a library list under a Content Security Policy.
- The version (YY.M.N) shown in the page (About, status bar, `<meta name="version">`) and returned by the engine's
  `version()`; `tools/set_version.mjs` keeps every manifest in step.

### Changed
- The product is named CivilKit Calcs; CalcpadCE is credited in the About text, README, LICENSE and NOTICE.

### Known limits
- Raster (SkiaSharp) plots, `#ProjectPath`/`#LibraryPath` path roots and compiled `.cpdz` worksheets are not supported.
- The Excel export was checked with openpyxl and LibreOffice, the Word export with LibreOffice; neither was opened in
  Microsoft Office.
- Deviations from CalcpadCE are listed in DEVIATIONS.md.
